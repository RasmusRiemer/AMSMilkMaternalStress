# AMSMilkMaternalStress
R analysis for the paper: Maternal stress in the early postpartum period is associated with alterations in human milk microbiome composition

**Important**: All metadata apart from time point and stress group has been randomized (see Randomize_metadata.R) and is available in the AMS_phyloseq_randomized.RDS file. This was done to ensure that code can be run and that main findings can be reproduced while respecting anonymity of the subject. AMS_analysis.html shows the full analysis using the non-randomized data, while the AMS_analysis_randomized.Rmd code allows running the code with randomized data mathing the AMS_analysis_randomized.html output. Full metadata is available upon request.
